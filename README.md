==================

Read Edge.org without experiencing bloody eyesockets (userscript/greasemonkey for Chrome and Firefox)

Edge.org has great content, but I want the experience of reading to be a little easier on the eyes.  The current website style is a cheese grater placed flat against my delicate corneas.

This script fixes all of the margins, switches to a serif font, and bumps the text dimensions in a few ways.  Now, the site can be comfortably viewed on both large and small-ish displays.

Note: this script will certainly break of Edge.org makes any major structural changes to their site.  I will probably be motivated to fix this when that happens, so please let me know about it.
